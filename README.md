# LibrarySelfCheckOutSystem
The Library Self Check-out System, developed in Java using NetBeans, allows users to borrow and return books autonomously. The project was completed in less than two weeks and features functionality for tracking transactions, limiting users to a maximum of 4 borrowed books, and updating book quantities.
